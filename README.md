# Berty Themes

## In Development!
The themes are not a number one issue for the Berty team, so they have been left behind quite a lot, you can stil use the themes (which you can select in the developer options) but it won't look great, I am currently looking into fixing it and make it functional again. But this will probably take a while.

A list of community made themes for the Berty messenger.

If you want to make your own theme, then the standart theme is listed below, you can just change the hex color codes to make your own theme.
```json
